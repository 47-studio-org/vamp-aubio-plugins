vamp-aubio-plugins
==================

A set of Vamp plugins (http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/vamp.html) for
audio feature extraction using Paul Brossier's aubio (http://aubio.piem.org/).

This set includes three plugins: Onset for onset detection, Pitch for
pitch tracking, and Notes for combined onset and pitch.  These plugins
compile into a single plugin library called vamp-aubio.so (the file
extension may vary depending on your platform).

To build: Make sure you have aubio-0.3.0 or newer installed, and the
Vamp plugin SDK.  These are available at the URLs given at the top.
Edit the Makefile appropriately, and type "make".  If the build
succeeds, copy the vamp-aubio library file into your personal or
system Vamp plugin location.

These plugins are Copyright 2006 Chris Cannam, distributed under the

aubio library.)
