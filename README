vamp-aubio-plugins
==================

A set of Vamp plugins (http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/vamp.html) for
audio feature extraction using Paul Brossier's aubio (http://aubio.piem.org/).

This set includes five plugins: Onset for onset detection, Pitch for
pitch tracking, Notes for combined onset and pitch, Tempo to estimate
and track beats based on onset locations, and Silence to find sections
of audio that are quieter than a given RMS signal level.  These
plugins compile into a single plugin library called vamp-aubio.so (the
file extension may vary depending on your platform).

To build: Make sure you have the Vamp plugin SDK and aubio
installed. (A version of aubio dating from at least July 2012 is
required.) These are available at the URLs given at the top.  Edit the
Makefile appropriately, and type "make".  If the build succeeds, copy
the vamp-aubio library file into your personal or system Vamp plugin
location.

These plugins are Copyright 2007-2012 Chris Cannam, distributed under the

aubio library.)
